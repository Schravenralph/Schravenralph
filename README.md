Hi, I’m **@Schravenralph**. I’m interested in software development, AI and cognition, data science... And guitar. Classical, melancholic, buttery-smooth guitar.

Recently, I transitioned from a data-analytic focus to engineering agentic-AI software. More generally, I’m a professional in the field of data science, machine learning, and generative AI.

I’m open for ideas and collaborations that center around data-and-AI-oriented business ideas.

You can reach me at: [ralphdrmoller@gmail.com](mailto:ralphdrmoller@gmail.com)  

Fun fact: I used to be a coach for an international eSports team, *Optimum Cowboys*. If you want to lose track of time in a conversation, ask me about it. Have a great engineering day!
