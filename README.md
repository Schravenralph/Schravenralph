Hi, I’m **@Schravenralph**. I’m interested in **software development, AI and cognition, data science... And guitar**  

Recently, I transitioned from a data-analytic focus to engineering software that implements generative AI throughout the application. More generally, I’m a professional in the field of **data science, machine learning, AI, and generative AI**  
I’m open for ideas and collaborations that center around **data-and-AI-oriented business ideas**.

You can reach me at: [ralphdrmoller@gmail.com](mailto:ralphdrmoller@gmail.com)  

Fun fact: I used to be a coach for an **international eSports team, Optimum Cowboys**. If you want to lose track of time in a conversation, ask me about it. Have a great engineering day!
